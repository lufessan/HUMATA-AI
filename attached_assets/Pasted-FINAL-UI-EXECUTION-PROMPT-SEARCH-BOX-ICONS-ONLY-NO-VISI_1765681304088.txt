FINAL UI EXECUTION PROMPT — SEARCH-BOX ICONS ONLY (NO VISION / NO OCR)

Role:
You are a senior UI/UX engineer and full-stack developer.
This task is UI-critical and must be executed exactly as specified.

❗ Ignore any previous Image / OCR / Vision requirements completely.
This task focuses ONLY on icons inside page-level input boxes and their correct behavior.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Expose all requested platform features as icons embedded inside the actual input/search box of each page (for example: the chat input field shown in the screenshots).

❌ Do NOT create a separate global box
❌ Do NOT place icons outside the input field
❌ Do NOT hide features in menus or settings

✅ Icons must live inside the same box where the user types.

🔴 CORE REQUIREMENT — WHERE ICONS MUST APPEAR

Icons must be injected inside the page-level input component, including but not limited to:

Chat page input box

Tool pages input/search boxes

Course / lesson page input boxes

Dashboard / home interactive input boxes

📌 If a page has an input field → icons must appear inside it.

Implement via a shared input wrapper component used across all sections.

🧩 FEATURES THAT MUST BE EXPOSED VIA ICONS

All the following features are already requested and must be exposed to users via icons:

Auto Mode Detection (Student / Teacher / Exam logic)

Student Mode

Teacher Mode

Smart Study Pack

Explain This (content/image/text)

Image → Lesson

Exam Simulator

“Why is this wrong?” Mode

Usage Insights

Difficulty Control

Memory by Topic

❗ A feature that is not visible = a feature that does not exist.

🎨 ICON GROUPING & VISUAL RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
❗ Avoid clutter at all costs

Do NOT show many icons individually

Group related features

Maximum 3 related features per grouped icon

✅ Recommended grouping (example – adapt if needed):

Group 1 — Learning Modes

Auto Mode

Student

Teacher

Group 2 — Study Tools

Smart Study Pack

Image → Lesson

Explain This

Group 3 — Assessment & Feedback

Exam Simulator

Why is this wrong?

Usage Insights

Optional small controls

Difficulty

Memory by Topic
(can be grouped or shown as compact toggles if space allows)

➡️ Total visible icon groups should remain clean and minimal (3–4 max).

🧠 CONTEXT-AWARE BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

Icons must change behavior based on the page they are used in, while keeping the same visual appearance.

Examples:

Chat page

Icons trigger AI behavior inside the conversation

Tool / Upload page

Icons apply actions to uploaded files

Course / Lesson page

Icons generate summaries, lessons, or exams

Dashboard

Icons emphasize insights and progress

⚠️ Same icon, different function depending on section context.

Implement via a lightweight context router:

currentPage → iconActionMapping

🧭 INTERACTION RULES

Icons must appear before typing

Icons must be:

Clickable

Touch-friendly (mobile)

Keyboard accessible

Selected mode/tool must:

Be visually highlighted

Persist during the session (localStorage)

Switching mode/tool must:

Immediately affect system behavior

NOT reload the page

🧪 FINAL VERIFICATION (DO NOT SKIP)

Before marking this task complete, you MUST provide:

1️⃣ Screenshots (required)

Showing icons inside the input box itself for:

Chat page

Tool page

Course / lesson page

Dashboard / home

2️⃣ Final checklist

For each item:

Implemented ✅

Tested ✅

Verified visually ✅

3️⃣ Confirmation

Explicitly confirm:

Icons are NOT in a separate box

Icons appear inside input fields

Icons appear in ALL sections

Icons are grouped and not cluttered

⛔ FORBIDDEN

Separate feature box

Hidden icons

Icons only on one page

Icons outside the input field

“Implemented but not shown”

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is considered complete ONLY IF:

All features are visible via icons

Icons are inside every page’s input box

UI remains clean and uncluttered

Screenshots prove correct placement

🧠 FINAL NOTE

If the user cannot discover a feature in 2 seconds,
the UI has failed — even if the backend works.

Design for visibility first.
