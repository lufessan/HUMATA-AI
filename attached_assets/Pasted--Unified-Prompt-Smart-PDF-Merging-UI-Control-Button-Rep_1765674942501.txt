🔥 Unified Prompt — Smart PDF Merging + UI Control Button Repositioning

Role:
You are an autonomous senior full-stack engineer and AI pipeline architect working on a production educational platform.

🎯 PART 1 — SMART MULTI-PAGE PDF TEXT MERGING (CRITICAL)
Objective

Implement an intelligent text-merging system for multi-page PDF files (especially scanned PDFs) so that the final output is a single, coherent Arabic text, as if written naturally by a human.

This is NOT simple concatenation.

Required Behavior

After OCR is applied to each page:

Treat all pages as one continuous document, not separate inputs.

Remove:

Repeated headers and footers

Page numbers

Repeated titles that appear on every page

Detect and reconnect sentences broken across pages:

If a sentence ends incompletely at the bottom of a page,
it must be merged with the beginning of the next page.

Preserve the logical flow of the content:

Definitions before explanations

Explanations before examples

Maintain clear structure:

Each section in its own paragraph

Headings separated clearly

Do NOT:

Remove meaningful content

Add new information

Change the original meaning

LLM Instruction for Merging

The following texts were extracted from consecutive pages of the same PDF document.
The text may contain:

Broken sentences across page boundaries

Repeated headers or footers

OCR artifacts

Your task:

Merge all pages into one unified Arabic text

Reconstruct broken sentences correctly

Remove repetitions

Preserve the original meaning and order

Output clean, well-structured Modern Standard Arabic

Page texts:

{{PAGES_TEXT_ARRAY}}


The result must be suitable for:

Educational explanation

Summarization

Question answering

🎯 PART 2 — UI FIX: FLOATING CONTROL BUTTONS POSITIONING
Objective

Update the UI so that floating control buttons (Menu button + WhatsApp button):

❌ Are NOT fixed at the bottom of the page

✅ Are positioned at the vertical center of the left side of the screen

Required UI Behavior

Both buttons must:

Appear as floating controls

Stay visible while scrolling

Positioning:

Left side of the viewport

Vertically centered

Layout:

Buttons stacked vertically

Clear spacing between them

Interaction:

Smooth hover and click effects

No obstruction of main content

Responsive behavior:

On mobile:

Adjust spacing

Keep buttons accessible

On desktop:

Fixed, stable position

UI Constraints

Do NOT place the buttons at the bottom

Do NOT hide them behind content

Do NOT break existing navigation logic

Maintain a clean, modern look

✅ FINAL EXPECTED RESULT

Multi-page PDFs are converted into one clean, readable Arabic document

OCR output feels human and coherent

Menu and WhatsApp buttons are:

Clearly visible

Centrally positioned on the left

Easy to access

Visually balanced

🧠 FINAL NOTE

This task requires both:

Linguistic intelligence (for text merging)

UI precision (for control positioning)

Implement both parts fully and professionally.
